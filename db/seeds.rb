  description: "This National Park Service-run area consists of over a million acres of lake and desert. The blue waters of Lake Powell are great for swimming, boating, fishing, and kayaking. Whatever your sport, this landscape will have you feeling like you found a desert oasis. Tours of the Glen Canyon Dam offer you the chance to learn about history and engineering. You may also want to go to the sacred, historic Rainbow Bridge National Monument. There's also the incredible Antelope Slot Canyons, only a short drive away. When you get tired of sightseeing, take a hike through wilderness, canyons and secret passageways.In terms of campgrounds, there's a lot to choose from, including many primitive sites. There are also developed sites with full water and electricity hookups.",

  description: "As with most things in Yosemite, bigger is better. Upper Pines Campground is no exception, boasting 240 campsites. It very well may be the most popular campground in Yosemite Valley, due, in part, to the views of surrounding icons, like El Capitan and Half Dome. Each site features a fire ring, food locker, and picnic table, and costs $26 per night. Upper Pines gets crowded in a hurry, so go in with the knowledge that you'll be nestled up next to your neighbor, with very little privacy (I mean...it is Yosemite Valley after all). That being said, the central location and convenience of Upper Pines makes it a no-brainer when visiting Yosemite. ",
